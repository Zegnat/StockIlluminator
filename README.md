Stock Illuminator
==================================================

A comical stock market simulator inspired by Grand Theft Auto V's mini stock
market game, originally created by [Eric][@eric]. Do you have what it takes to
become an Ascended Being and own your own Extraterrestrial Alliance?

## GitHub edition

The GitHub edition exists so the mini game can get some love again. The
libraries used have become outdated and it no longer shows up well on mobile
browsers. All changes made are instantly playable on GitHub.
